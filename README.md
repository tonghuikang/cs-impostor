# How to be a CS impostor

[TOC]

After failing multiple technical interviews for being clueless on the computer science concepts, I realised that I needed to be better impostor.

Collaborators welcome and much needed, because I do not have the required background (my degree is not Computer Science). I do not know if I am even asking the correct questions.



This repository compiles answers optimised for interviews

- The purpose of your answer is to demostrate knowledge of the subject.
- You should not explain everything.
- The answer should be at most three sentences. They will ask for more if they want.
- You should know what you are talking about. Concede early if you do not know more.
- To show your experience and make your answer unique, you may want to elaborate with an example on how you applied the concepts in question.



Useful resources

- [GeeksForGeeks articles](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-asked-computer-science-subjects-interview-questions-in-amazon-microsoft-flipkart/). They tend to explain everything, here I want to summarise the answer that it is good for interview.
- [donnemartin's System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) This describes how to prepare to interview questions on designing large-scale systems.
- [Tech Interview Handbook](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/) How to apply for job, and algorithms.
- Course objectives of the courses you have taken. When asked what you have learnt from the course, you can use that to recall.



### Networking

What happens when you access a website?

- DNS lookup for IP address, and then?



What are some networking protocols?

- (no idea - UDP?)



### Cybersecurity

How does secure communciation happen through https?

- Security and encryption process - Authentication with Certificate Authority with asymmetric encryption, symmetric for secure communication




### Operating Systems

What is the difference between process and threads?

- A process may have multiple threads. Different processes do not share memory, different threads of a process share a memory



### Databases

How do we index a database and why?

- Databases use index to allow faster access to an entry in the database. indexing is done with balance binary search tree to allow O(log n) acceess to the element. you may index the table on multiple columns. the downside of using indexes is storage cost, as well as increase time when modifying the table



What is the difference between MySQL, PostgresSQL

- No idea





### Machine Learning

What is the difference between RNN, LSTM and GRU?

What is the difference between random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost?
