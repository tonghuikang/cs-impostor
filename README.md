# How to be a CS impostor

After failing multiple technical interviews for being clueless on the computer science concepts, I realised that I needed to be better impostor.

This document compiles answers optimised for software engineer interviews. Refer to the other document for data science topics.

### Collaboration

Collaborators are welcome and much needed, because I do not have the required background (my degree is not Computer Science). 

I do not know if I am even asking the correct questions.

Please message me somehow, if you are interested.

### My current thoughts on this document

- I need to identify the key value proposition of this document. Currently it is canned answers to technical knowledge questions asked in interviews, and for undergraduates.
- If the key value proposition is as above, are there currently work done on it? The Tech Interview Handbook, and the System Design Primer is something I want to emulate.
  - This overlaps partly with the System Design Primer. The difference it - question and answer format, covers other concepts. This focuses on new grads, people with experience can better relate to the System Design Primer.
- This is meant for undergraduates because I am graduating soon. People with experience should find this useful too, the difference is they can back their answers up with real experience.
- Are the questions really asked in interviews? Most of the questions are things that someone with some experience "should know" (e.g. how to frontend) - but they asked?
- Currently I am organising and compiling the question to ask. Then I will interrogate some of my expert friends for their answers and force them to do a pull request.




### How do you use this

For each topic, there are interview questions, and there is a proposed answer for the question.

- The purpose of your answer is to demostrate knowledge of the subject, rather than to teach the concept. You do not need to explain everything from scratch.
- You should keep your answer concise. You need to condense all you know into around three sentences. They will ask for more if they want. There is likely many other questions to go through, and you might need to code too.
- You should know what you are talking about. It is better to concede when you do not know further.
- To show your experience and make your answer unique, you may want to elaborate with an example on how you applied the concepts in question.



### What should this contain

- No opinions. While we should have opinions (on ethics, predictions, controversies), you have to figure them out and justify them yourself.
- References. This will serve as attribution, and also further reading material to understand the topic.
- Good questions. This should contain questions that can be asked in a technical interview. It should not be a history quiz or a numbers trivia.



### Scope of Coverage

We would not cover all aspects of computer science, or even everything that is taught in school. We want questions that are actually asked in interviews.

#### Relevant roles

This interview content guide is meant for new grads. For new graduates,  companies usually recruit for "Software Engineer" or "Data Scientist" and then matchmake your role depending on location and requirements.

- Software Engineer
  - Frontend and Mobile (explain job scope here)
  - Backend (explain job scope here)
  - Data Engineer (explain job scope here)
  - Site Reliability Engineer (explain job scope here)
  - Security Engineer (explain job scope here)
  - DevOps / Productivity Engineering (explain job scope here)
- Data Analyst / Scientist (explain job scope here)
  - Research Engineer / Scientist (usually Masters/PhD required)
- Solution Architect (you sell your company's technical products to customers and provide advice)

Regardless of your technical role, it is important to have some basic knowledge of other technologies. This helps to develop a bigger picture and inform you what is important when you develop your technical solutions. (What does this sentence actually mean lol)



#### Excluded topics

We want interview questions that are immediately relevant to a software engineer or a machine learning practitioner. The following topics are excluded

- Algorithms (please refer to other resources to prepare for the coding component of the interview)
- Mathematics and Theory of Computation
- Computation Structures (Arithmetric Logic Unit) - will this ever be asked in an interview?
- Robotics
- Game Design and Development
- Graphics and Image Processing
- Data Analysis and Information Visualisation



### Useful resources

- [GeeksForGeeks articles](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-asked-computer-science-subjects-interview-questions-in-amazon-microsoft-flipkart/). They tend to explain everything, here I want to summarise the answer that it is good for interview.
- [donnemartin's System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer). This describes how to prepare to interview questions on designing large-scale systems.
- [Tech Interview Handbook](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/). How to apply for technical role from resume writing to offer negotiation, and a gentle introduction to algorithms.
- [MIT CSAIL Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). Introduces tools for software development which is hardly covered in courses.
- [Programmer competency matrix](https://sijinjoseph.netlify.app/programmer-competency-matrix/). An outline of the the different competency levels of each domain of computer science.
- Syllabus and Course Objectives. They are good summaries of the courses that you have taken. [Attempted comparison of CS courses between Singapore universities](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g3yion/uni_computer_science_curricula/)
- Job Descriptions. Your cover letter should address the requirements point-by-point. Interviews are also likely designed to verify whether you fulfill the requirements.
- Past Interview questions. Some past interviewees share their interviewing experience on online platforms such as [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.sg/Interview), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience), [BinarySearch](https://binarysearch.com/). Many of the questions here are adapted from these. 
- Past Successes. Companies are likely to hire based on experience with previous hires. You can search up previous year's hires on LinkedIn and use them as a standard to estimate your chances of success. Regardless, do not be discouraged to submit your resume as long as you are sincerely interested in the role.

# Computer Science Topics

I have organised the topics under four fields

- Backend Engineering
- Frontend Engineering
- Security Engineering
- Engineering Management



## Backend Engineering

Technical solutions often involve business logic and information. Business logic requires computational work, and databases require storage. Appreciation for the field of backend engineering will help in (I need help pinning down the benefits)



### Operating Systems

[SUTD 50.005 Computer System Engineering](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50005-computer-system-engineering)

[SUTD 50.043 Database and Big Data Systems](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50043-database-and-big-data-systems)

How do we index a database and why?

- Databases use index to allow faster access to an entry in the database. indexing is done with balance binary search tree to allow O(log n) acceess to the element. you may index the table on multiple columns. the downside of using indexes is storage cost, as well as increase time when modifying the table





What is the difference between SQL-based database, and NoSQL-based databases?
